# Piano-Tiles

## How To Download
First download either the Netbeans or Eclipse IDE's. Then download the entire zipped folder, unzip the folder and open the project inside the IDE.


## How To Play
The Grid is composed of a 4x4 grid. Press on the Play button and black tiles will begin to spawn at the top row and fall town one tile as time passes. You must survive 60 seconds but if you press on a white tile or a black tile makes it past the bottom tile, you lose. As the timer comes closer to 60 seconds, additional tiles will drop and at increase speeds. Good Luck!
